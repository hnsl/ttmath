TTMath - a bignum library for C++

TTMath is a small library which allows one to perform arithmetic operations
with big unsigned integer, big signed integer and big floating point
numbers. It provides standard mathematical operations like adding,
subtracting, multiplying, dividing etc. With the library also goes
a mathematical parser which helps you solving input formulas read directly
from a user.

TTMath is developed under the BSD licence which means that it is free
for both personal and commercial use.

The library has some technical limitations:
 * there are only two platforms that are supported: x86 and x86_64,
 * you can use this library only with the C++ programming language.

The main goal of the library is to allow one to use big values in the same
way as the standard types like int, float, etc. It does not need to be
compiled first because the whole library is written as the C++ templates.
This means only C++ developers can use this library and one thing they have
to do is to use 'include' directive of the preprocessor. How big the
values can be is set directly in the source code by the programmer.
